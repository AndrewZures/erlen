# Erlen

Erlen is short for Erlenmeyer, a type of laboratory flask that looks like
Hireology's logo. Erlen is a library that provides a framework for schema
creation, validation, and serialization. A schema is a definition of a
resource or a resource group and describes what is expected in a transaction
regardless of the protocol--e.g., HTTP, RPC, Ruby call, and etc. In other
words, Erlen allows you to define contracts and share them across different
services and also enforce what is defined in the contracts.
